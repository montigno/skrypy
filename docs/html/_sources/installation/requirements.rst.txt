Requirements
============
.. important::
   First of all, you should carefully select the correct Python 3 version (3.6 to 3.12) to install the Skrypy virtual environment.

If you plan to use `the Matlab engine <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html>`__, you should check `the supported versions <https://fr.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html>`__. |br|
Otherwise it is recommended to use at least Python3.12 version.

If you don't have Python3 or not the right version, you can try this method (eg you want to install python3.11)::


	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install python3.11
